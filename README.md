Adaptive Modulation Regenerator and Distance Aware Algorithm for Dynamic Routing in Elastic Optical Networks

The Elastic Optical Network is a technology that offers versatile conversion of modulation format, allowing for more effective use of spectrum resources compared to the traditional fixed grid in WDM networks. Additionally, the content-oriented services offered by geographically distributed data centres raise a need for cost-effective and scalable data delivery. In this paper, we discuss Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Allocation (RMSA) in content-oriented networks, based on the Elastic Optical Network. We propose a new adaptive modulation, regenerator and distanceaware algorithm. Our findings discover an interesting trade-off between the request blocking and regenerator use.
